This project provides an alternative to the traditional physical mouse by allowing users to control their computer's cursor using hand gestures. It leverages computer vision and machine learning algorithms to track hand movements in real-time via a webcam, translating them into mouse actions like movement, clicking, and scrolling. The system is designed to be intuitive and can be used without any additional hardware beyond a standard webcam
